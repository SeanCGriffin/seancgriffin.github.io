In 2017 and 2018 I taught two classes at the University of Maryland. Unfortunately, my research lately has had me too busy to teach, but I still regularly supervise a number of undergrads and NASA interns working in the lab.

### Fall 2018: ASTR288C -- Astronomy Research Techniques
This course covered an introduction to scientific analysis (parsing data, fitting, "tools of the trade") and independent research. 

### Fall 2017: ASTR288P -- UNIX and Scientific Programming
In this class, we began with a very basic introduction to scientific programming ("the command line is a tool that exists") and progressed through to general use of <I>\*NIX</I> systems. An introduction to scripting (bash) and Python were given, and various analysis concepts were presented, such as data extraction and fitting. Courses were taught using GitHub and Python Notebooks as a base for <a href="https://github.com/SeanCGriffin/astr288p_student" target="blank">accessing course notes</a>. 

### Outreach

I have a long history of working in outreach. 
Indeed, my first job out of highschool was as a camp counselor at Space Camp Canada at the Laval <a href="https://cosmodome.org/" target="blank">Cosmodome</a> outside of Montreal.

I was also a founding member of the Astro McGill public outreach group which now hosts massively successful lectures to hundreds of members of the public. I was also a co-host of the <a href="http://www.astro.physics.mcgill.ca/podcasts.php" target="blank">Astro McGill podcast</a>.
